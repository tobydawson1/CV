## Toby Dawson

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what exictes you about tech.

I am a full stack developer looking to progress my learning and knowledge in a junior development role within the London tech industry. I have not always had a burning thirst for knowelege or for learning and I often believed my ability's were based around interactions with others, thinking outside the box and pure hard work. However, since being shown how accesible and fun becoming a developer can be it's safe to say I have been quenching my now parched throat daily.

Since graduating from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in City and Regional Planning I have worked in Switzerland in a extremely high end and demanding Hotel as a host and followed that up into a management role for a 100 cover restaurant in Vauxhall. I am extremely active and always looking for ways to improve my quality of life and the Tech industry has really excited me as I can see a thriving industry with opertunity's around every corner.
