## Toby Dawson

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what exictes you about tech.

I am a full stack developer looking to progress my learning and knowledge in a junior development role within the London tech industry. I have not always had a burning thirst for knowelege or for learning and I often believed my ability's were based around interactions with others, thinking outside the box and pure hard work. However, since being shown how accesible and fun becoming a developer can be it's safe to say I have been quenching my now parched throat daily.

Since graduating from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in City and Regional Planning I have worked in Switzerland in a highly demanding Hotel as a host and followed that up into a supervisor role for a 100 cover restaurant in Vauxhall. I am extremely active and always looking for ways to improve my quality of life and the Tech industry has really excited me as I can see a thriving industry with opertunity's around every corner.

# Knowing when to Lead

In the industries I have worked in you often have individuals who do not help situations when they take control as they are not the best person for the job. I don't like to dominate rooms I think its far more effective analysing situation, seeing the problem and picking the right person for each job. I was entrusted with responsibility in Switzerland to be the point of contact for the guests when our managers were not working whichlead my to my management role where I had to deal every day with complaints, cashing up, organising staff and much more which has made me acccustomed to the pressure of having to make decisions.

# Composure

Often situations can get out of hand and behond the realms of control, I pride myself on being able to weather the storm and stay calm during these situations. When everyone else starts to raise their voice or become sharp with one another this is when I like to show my ability's to act possitively and effectively. 

# Team Player 

Working within a team is part and parcel of most professional work places and this was certainly the case for my previous roles. In my logistics role I worked in a team of 7 and we often had to organise 3 different vehicles travelling to up to 9 campus's across 3 city's all rotating in and out of one storage facility. Organistation and communication had to happen every day otherwise we simply would not of met our deadlines. 

# Enthusiastic 

Possitivity and enthusiasm is something that lightens up the whole room, my work has lead me to working 12/15 hour shifts often late into the night with increasingly drunk individuals. If you let your head drop not only do your fellow staff memebers feel it but your work also suffers which in my case my work were my clients.
